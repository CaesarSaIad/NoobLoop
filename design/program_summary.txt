Although there are many programs in the market that loop audio, most of 
them are geared towards professionals with extensive experience in working 
with sound. It is currently difficult to find a program made for the PC 
that is free and user-friendly. NoobLoop is a simplified version of the 
audio looper which only includes the essential elements of the audio 
looper that anyone can use without difficulty. NoobLoop also comes with a 
side sampler mode, in which the user can make a drum machine to make beats,
components of which are mapped onto keyboard keys.
